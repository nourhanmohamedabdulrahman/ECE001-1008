<p style="font-size:25px">It is the process of writing instructions and commands to a computer or other device, to direct it and inform it of how to handle data or how to perform a series of required actions.
The programming process follows rules for the language chosen by the programmer.
Each language has its own characteristics that set it apart and makes it suitable to varying degrees for each type of program.
It also has common characteristics and common boundaries, given that all of these languages ​​are designed to interact with computers.

<p style="font-size:25px">Programming languages ​​are developing with Hardware. When the electronic computer was invented (after the electrical arithmetic devices in) - and the computer was operating in large numbers of electronic valves - the programming language was also complicated, and it was a series of numbers and written in the form of long programming codes these numbers are the numbers zero 0 and one 1 and this language It is called bilingual or machine language, and this was difficult for programmers. But by creating a transistor that made the computer smaller in size and increased its capabilities, programmers were able to create programming languages ​​easier to use, and programming languages ​​became understandable. Development and facilitation is still ongoing</p>
