Special design)
Information and storage
Information is stored in current digital devices in the form of numbers according to the binary counting system (i.e. dependent on 0 and 1).
Generally speaking, modern processors do not deal with single bits but rather with groups of bits that can include:
8 bits = 1 byte, which is the smallest information storage unit in modern computers.
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 bits.
Using 8 bits, for example, 256 different values ​​can be formed, and this value can be between 0 and 255. The programming language function represents the exploitation of a unit or group of units (symbols) to store real-life information such as names, measurements or bank account numbers.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">Orders and organizing their conduct
The programmer performs operations on information units such as storing, reading and comparing them, and calculations can also be performed on them, and the operations follow the specific rules for the language. The programming language has another role, which is to control the organization of the conduct of operations, as it directs the implementation of its steps with the same sequence of writing by the programmer.

The language also enables the selection and branching process to be performed, by entering a logical condition on the basis of which the computer selects the direction of continuing the work</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">Let us suppose that the program that the programmer wants to make divides two numbers that the user chooses, and shows the result on the screen, and it is known that dividing by zero is not permissible, and accordingly, the programmer must specify in this program this choice: if the denominator is contrary to zero, then the program runs the computer He performs the operation and gives the result. If the denominator is zero, the program does not perform the operation, but rather warns that the user tried to divide by zero. And orders can be organized in another way, where the execution of an order or a group of orders occurs repeatedly in a circle, and orders can also be divided into sub units that each unit performs a specific work, and the goal is to divide the work into parts that are easy to work on separately in the form of annular courses</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">Special design
Each language has a special design in terms of handling the data, and in terms of the methods and facilities provided by the language to deal with a specific problem.

Programming languages ​​can be classified in terms of how to build programs into procedural languages ​​(Basic, Fortran), which are serial languages, the basis of which they are built is the procedures to be applied to the data and the variables. Object languages ​​(C, Java, Delphi) are non-serial, and are based on the elements and variables used within the program to be converted, by applying a specific set of procedures to them.</p>
