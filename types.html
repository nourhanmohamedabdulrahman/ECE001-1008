<p style="font-size:25px">By level, programming languages ​​can be divided into two types, depending on their level in terms of proximity to the machine language, which is the language the computer directly understands, and is represented by numbers. The first type of programming languages ​​according to this classification are the low-level programming languages, which are the programming languages ​​closest to the machine language, so machine language is the lowest level, and comes at a lower level than the assembly language, since these languages ​​are It is characterized by the fact that it only includes the commands that the computer understands, and therefore is the most distant from the language a person understands, but at the same time it allows the programmer full control of his program.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">The other type of programming languages ​​by level is High-level languages, which are the furthest from the machine language, and the closest to understanding a person, but they also do not provide the same amount of control as low-level languages ​​allow the programmer, in terms of how the computer organizes memory And data. Important features in high-level programming languages ​​are enabling the programmer to use Variables, Objects, Routines and Loops. Sometimes, through high-level programming languages, a large amount of Command to write only one line. Examples of this type of programming language are Python and Ruby.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">An example of this type of programming language is the C language. In the interpreted programming languages, the Interpreter program is used to implement the program directly without the need to translate it, as the texts (or so-called script) are executed by the interpreted program itself, so The interpreted program must be installed on any device that is intended to run the program that is written on it, which makes this type of program executable on any operating system as long as the interpreted program is installed on it</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">According to the way it is implemented, programming languages ​​can be divided in terms of the way they are implemented in a computer into two types, the first of which is the compiled or translated programming languages, and the other type, they are the interpreted programming languages ​​(Interpreted). Compiled programming languages ​​in which the compiler program is used to convert it into a machine language dedicated to the operating system on which the translation was performed, and it is in the form of a program that can be executed by calling its name, if the operation was performed in the Linux operating system for example, The user will not be able to execute the same program on the Windows operating system, just as in the conversion process, the program is examined and detected for any errors - not logical errors in it.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">Depending on the usage, programming languages ​​can be classified into several types according to the purpose of their use. There are programming languages ​​for developing and creating websites. Examples include Javascript, PHP, Python, and other languages ​​that can be used. In developing mobile applications such as those that run Android and iOS operating systems, examples of these languages ​​are Java and Swift.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">One of the features of the interpreted programming languages ​​is the ability of the programmer to directly modify the program without the need to recompile it, but the interpreter's ongoing process during the program's running will make the implementation process slow compared to the converted programs. An example of this type of programming language is Python</p>
